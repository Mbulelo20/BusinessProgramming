What Is Agile?

Agile is a methodology that is used in managing large projects, such as software development. Agile involves designers, and developers, and business in breaking down the large project into iterations; iterations are small manageable chunks.

Agile is dependent on the customer’s requirements, the final product, the ability to react to change after a plan and on the interactions of the individuals involved.

These are some of the characteristics of Agile:

° Modularity
° Iterative
° Time boxing
° parsimony
° incremental 

Some of the advantages of  agile:

° Agile is flexible: changes can be introduced during a later stage of development
° It has sprints: set periods of time in which work has to be done and reviewed
° Small amounts of work are affected when clients add or remove some of requirements

SCRUM

In a  scrum, a backlog is set and continuously updated. Sprint, sprint planning, daily scrum (15 min team meeting), sprint review and sprint retrospective are all entailed in a scrum.
Advantages include:

* Flexibilty
* Adptabilty
* Creativity
• Lower costs and improved quality
• Time-to-Market

Disadvantages are:

• Training and skill required
• Integration with Project/Program management
• Scalability

Feature Driven Development

FDD delivers working software constantly in a timely manner. The process follows these steps: Develop overall model: in which requirements are collected from the user, a list of features is created, then the features are planned, and the last step is the modellign iteration.
Advantages are:
• Can adapt to changing environment
• Customer satisfaction through active involvement of users.
• Requires little documentation
• Eeviews are done regularly

Disadvantages:

• Lack of documentation can be a challenge for new members
• Time consuming, and costly, due to constant changes
• Development can go off track is client representative is not clear enogh about the feature

Xtreme Programming

Key feaures in this technique include Simplicity, Communication, Feedback and Courage. XP breaks down the software development life cycle into short development cycles. Changes at any stage during the development life cycle are afforded.
These are the advantages:
• Interaction between team members; everyone is up to date.
• Reduces costs
